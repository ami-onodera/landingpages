Here are some webpages I developed as CSS and JavaScript practice:

ðŸŒ¿ **[Plant Life](https://plant-life.vercel.app/)** features: collapsible menu, images are positioned randomly on mouseover, slideshow on click. 

ðŸ“¸ **[Photography Portfolio](https://parallax-photography.vercel.app)** features: parallax effect on squares and circles, progress bar on top, count of the scroll distance, change of title and count according to each "client".

ðŸ¦· **[Bites Dental Products](https://bites-dental.vercel.app)** features: top bar changing colors on scroll, content appearing on scroll, the eyes of the little face on the top bar follows the mouse around. If you leave your mouse at the same place for 3 seconds, the eyes go to a random direction.

ðŸ‘¯ **[Words of Womxn](https://words-of-womxn.vercel.app)** features: logo changing size on scroll, parallax effect on images and text, background changing colors on scroll. When you click anywhere on the page, 6 different types of "stamps" will appear, each one with rotation effect and sound effect.
