### Landing Pages

Here are some pages I developed as CSS and JavaScript practice:

**[Plant Life](https://plant-life.vercel.app/)** features: collapsible menu, images are positioned randomly on mouseover, slideshow on click. 

**[Photography Portfolio](https://parallax-photography.vercel.app)** features: parallax effect on squares and circles, progress bar on top, count of the scroll distance, change of title and count according to each "client".
